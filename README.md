# Project-1

## Our project is combined application for movie search and food recipe search. So you can can choose the movie you like and search for nice home made meal recipe to enjoy healthy food instead of fast food. 
## Once user openes application he is presented with search movies section, then he is given selections based on the search request. Once user chooses to see more details about the movie, he is taken on the second page with movie description, that has section of food recipe search.
